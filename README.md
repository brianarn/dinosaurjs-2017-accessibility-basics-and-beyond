Materials from the DinosaurJS 2017 Accessibility workshop!

## Presentation

The presentation is built using Reveal.js, and can be found in the
`presentation` folder. Simply open up the `index.html` in a browser and you
should be set. You can also `npm install && npm start` in the directory for the
full experience.

## Before and After demo

The Before and After demo, found in the `wai-bad-demo` folder, is courtesy of
the W3C and can be found at their [Before and After Demonstration
website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/).

If you're running on a system with php available, you can execute `php -S
localhost:4000` within the `wai-bad-demo` to serve it locally.

It can also be interacted with directly at the above website.
